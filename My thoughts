Now, I am going to give you my opinion on virtualisation software such as VM Ware Workstation, VirtualBox, or Microsoft Hyper-V. I just want to state that I appreciate the fact that the software is free.

Now, here is what I think:

Virtualisation software is an excellent tool that does the world quite a bit of good. There are numerous advantages to taking advantage of virtualisation, such as:

Saving money on resources, such as saving money on buying new computers.
Keeping legacy support systems running, mainly so you can use software that no longer works on modern operating systems.
You can run several VMs on an onsite physical server, which reduces the load (computing, electrical) which not only increases the lifespan of a server, but it also saves space.
One of the biggest strengths of virtualisation is the ability to create a safe sandbox environment, should you follow the correct isolation and networking protocols.
Scalability is a massive utility of virtualisation since you can control the amount of resource utilization a certain task needs, which is great for efficiency and more importantly, flexibility.

Anyway, that is my opinion on that. Also, is it "virtualisation" or "virtualization"? The academia seems to be unclear on the topic, so feel free to correct me.
